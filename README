Introduction
============

An inline crypto approach in eXpress Data Path (XDP) with a hardware-based
accelerator, QuickAssist Technology (QAT), by introducing a new eBPF
accelerator device map framework. The ingress encrypted packets from
network interface controller (NIC) driver would be redirected to QAT
accelerator device for decryption. Afterwards the flexible packet
processing continues based on the plaintext.

Applicable to different encrypted packets with protocols like IPSec,
WireGuard, dTLS, QUIC, etc.

The framework opens the opportunities to various accelerators which can
manipulate the network packet, collaborating with eBPF program in kernel.
It can facilitate different kinds of hardware-based accelerators (e.g.,
FPGA, ASIC, GPU, etc.) to boost its capability of processing network
packet in XDP layer.

Linux kernel
============

There are several guides for kernel developers and users. These guides can
be rendered in a number of formats, like HTML and PDF. Please read
Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst first.

In order to build the documentation, use ``make htmldocs`` or
``make pdfdocs``.  The formatted documentation can also be read online at:

    https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/

There are various text files in the Documentation/ subdirectory,
several of them using the Restructured Text markup notation.

Please read the Documentation/process/changes.rst file, as it contains the
requirements for building and running the kernel, and information about
the problems which may result by upgrading your kernel.
